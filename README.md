# Patent and Research Data Parsing Tools

## Overview
The Patent and Research Data Parsing Tools are designed to facilitate the extraction and manipulation of data from patent and research documents. The tools allow users to efficiently parse complex formats and extract meaningful information for analysis or further processing.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Retrieve essential information from patent and research documents.
- **Data Transformation**: Convert parsed data into various formats suitable for different applications.
- **Customizability**: Tailor the parsing logic to specific document types or structures.

## Usage
To utilize the parsing tools, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Required Libraries**: Ensure that you have all the necessary libraries installed (e.g., JSON parsing libraries).
2. **Load Your Document**: Use the provided methods to load the document you wish to parse.
3. **Call the Parsing Functions**: Utilize the parsing functions to extract the data you need.
4. **Process the Retrieved Data**: Once the data is extracted, you can manipulate it as needed for your analysis.

## Examples
### Example 1: Parsing a Patent Document
```python
parsed_data = parse_patent_document('path/to/patent.pdf')
print(parsed_data)
```

### Example 2: Parsing a Research Paper
```python
parsed_data = parse_research_paper('path/to/research.docx')
print(parsed_data)
```
